README file for SCORCH v1.5

Updated 3 JUNE 95

This file contains trivia, last minute instructions, and changes to SCORCH,
in no particular order.

What's New in Version 1.5?
==========================

   This version is designed to solidify the features integrated so far,
   and is consists mostly of bug fixes and small improvements.

	- Support for most 256 color video modes
	- Scanned Mountain Ranges!!
	- New sky: Cavern... actually this will be a landscape in the
	  next version of Scorch
	- New sky: Pitch black... test your skills at night!
	- Team support: three kinds, to please all people!
	- Real timer delays - great for people with 486's and up.
	- New weapon: lasers.
	- New shield: SuperMag - tough as a heavy shield, pushes missiles
	  like a deflector, and bounces away any that get through all that
	  like a force shield.  Yikes!
	- Better keyboard support in simultaneous mode - multiple players
	  on the keyboard no longer conflict with each other.
	- Joystick support has been modified to support Gravis Gamepads.
	- Somewhat improved computer algorithms
	- Foreign character support

Printing the Documentation:
===========================
Make sure your printer is on, online, and has paper.  SCORCH.DOC takes
57 pages.  Then type COPY SCORCH.DOC PRN.  Then hit Enter, of course.
Or use any program that will print files, such as your favorite word
processor.

VGA note:
=========
Scorched Earth (SCORCH) is a VGA only game. It will not run on any other
type of system.

Fixing Problems:
================
If you have a problem with SCORCH when changing settings, you can just
delete the SCORCH.CFG file and run SCORCH.  It will return to the default
settings.  Or, just run FIX.BAT, and it will get rid of the bad SCORCH.CFG
file.

Useless Statistics:
===================
For those who are interested, Scorched Earth 1.5 was written using
Borland C++ 4.0 and Turbo Assembler 3.0.  There are approximately 122
C/C++ files and 3 assembly files, totalling over 785K of source code.
Scanned mountain ranges were processed with Adobe Photoshop.

Acknowledgments:
================
There are far too many people who have contributed to the success of
Scorch to mention here.  Thanks to all who have sent letters pointing
out bugs and offering suggestions.   Keep 'em coming!

Special thanks goes to the Scorch 1.50 Beta Testers... great job guys!!
Any bugs that remain are surely the author's fault.

Deluxe Registration!!
=====================
Due to popular demain, "Deluxe Registration" is once again available!
Deluxe Registration includes the most recent copy of Scorch on disk and
a complete bound copy of the enhanced manual.  The enhanced manual
contains the same text as the file "scorch.doc", but is illustrated with
tables, icons from the game, and keys for all the options.  Deluxe
Registration costs $30 instead of $20.  Deluxe Registration is available
in the U.S. only, due to shipping expenses and difficulties.

Hang On A Minute... Why Does Scorch 1.5 Cost More?
==================================================
Simply put, I was unable to make enough profit at $10 a copy to pay for
new compilers, graphics libraries, and tools to keep up with the
next release.  Hopefully the price will stabilize at $20 for a long time.

Upgrades
========
If you have registered an earlier version of Scorch, you can get a
free upgrade by sending a self-addressed, stamped disk mailer, and
a blank, formatted disk.  Mailers which are not stamped cannot be
returned.  Please give us enough information to find you in the 
customer database, or we cannot honor this free upgrade.  Alternately,
you can upgrade to a 1.5 basic registration for $10 - this covers the
disk and postage from our side.

Site Licenses
=============
Site licenses are available at MASSIVE discounts... contact Scorch HQ
with your specific requests.

Scorch Fans Outside the U.S.:
=============================
To register Scorch, all you need to do is figure out some way to get
$20 to me.  Try going to your local bank and asking for a "U.S. Dollar
World Money Order".  I hope to make international editions of Scorch
as time permits.

Other problems/suggestions:
===========================
If you have any ideas or bug reports, please contact the author as
indicated below.  Please do not call.  All comments are welcome, whether
or not you are a registered user.

Scorched Earth also has a home page on the World Wide Web:

============================================================================
Most of all, Don't forget that Scorched Earth is Shareware.  The game is
good, if somewhat addictive.  The price is reasonable.  So why not support 
the game, its further development, and the whole shareware concept by sending
in your $20.

As they say on T.V. "Thank you for your support."
