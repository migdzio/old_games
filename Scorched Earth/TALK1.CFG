In times of trouble, go with what you know.
Die!
Eat my shorts!
You're toast!
Banzai!
From Hell's heart I stab at thee...
I didn't do it.  Nobody saw me do it.
Take a hike!
You're dead meat.
Make my day.
Charge!
Attack!
You're outta here.
Wattsa matta you?
Freeze, or I'll shoot!
Ha ha ha.
We come in peace - Shoot to kill!
In your face!
Die Commie Pig!
I love the smell of Napalm in the morning.
Victory!
Show some respect.
Just who do you think you are?
Look out below!
Knock, Knock.
Look over there.
Guess what's coming for dinner?
Merry Christmas.
Open wide!
Here goes nothing...
Don't worry, it isn't a live round.
Blood, Pain, Violence!
Take this, sissy!
I shall flatten you!
I shall smash your ugly tank!
I wonder what this button does?
Don't take this personally.
Would this make you mad?
I told you to leave my sister alone!
I could spare you, but why?
My bomb is bigger than yours.
Don't forget about me!
Hasta la vista, Baby!
This is your brain on Scorch.
Take this!
This screen ain't big enough for the both of us.
Die, Alien Swine!
Say "Arrgghhhhh...."
I shall oil my turret with your blood.
Die, tank-scum!
I'm gonna break your face!
Mama said knock you out!
I hope you enjoy pain!
Parting is such sweet sorrow... Not!
